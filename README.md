 needed an analysis and business advice advice on what to do for the following year. Using the Office Supply dataset The stakeholders require my team to Produce a report on all products sold between January and December 2014, showing number of sales, sales proportions and financial performance, and to Ensure my analysis can be used to determine whether there is growth or decline on any of the product lines.
The dataset provided by the company consist a single table with five columns namely; Segment, State, Product, discount band, units sold, manufacturing price, sale price and date. 
I imported the datasets into Power BI, cleaned and transformed the data. I used the Dax function to assertain the discount rate, calculated columns and measure was also used to add the necessary columns into the table such as the Gross Sales, Revenue, Profit before Tax, Profit Margin, Tax on Profit (tax rate 5%), Profit after Tax. 
The right visuals was used to create a report. I used a card to show the Total revenue, Total Profit, and profit margin. A line chart was used to show the trend of sales while Column Charts and Stacked Column Charts was used for the other visuals. a slicer and a calender was also used to make the report interactive. 

With this report, I was able to Compare 2013 Q4 and 2014 Q4 figures to highlight year on year results, I was able to determine What key products are the drivers of performance? Give an advice on what product is to be discontinued due to poor outcomes, additionally I determined What product do they pay the highest tax on?
a. Overall
b. For each state
c. For each segment.


In Conclusion, From this analysis, it can be inferred that Biro, Pencil and A4 Paper are the drivers of performance [Office Supply presentation.pptx](https://github.com/Rachyable/Officce-Supply-Analysis/files/10410806/Office.Supply.presentation.pptx)
a power point presentation was sent to the stakeholder for better commnuication, presentation and Story telling of the data. This will help S.O Company to make effective decision for the year 2015.
